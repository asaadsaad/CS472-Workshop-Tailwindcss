### CS472-Workshop-Tailwindcss
The goal of this workshop is to learn the fundamentals of [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/). 
* I will demo how to setup/install tailwindcss, and go over some essential utility classes, and teach you the layout classes for `grid`, `flex`, and `position`.

2. Refactor Homework 01 portfolio to use tailwind.
3. Refactor Homework 02 layout exercises to use tailwind, including the responsive layout.
4. Submit/push your refactored code by the end of the day 9 PM.
  
I'm available to answer any questions between 10:00 AM to noon, and 2:00 PM to 5:00 PM. When you finish, explore [tailwind components](https://tailwindui.com/?ref=top) and [templates](https://www.tailwindawesome.com/?price=free&type=template).
