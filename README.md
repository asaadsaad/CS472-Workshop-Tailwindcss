### CS472-Workshop-Tailwindcss
The goal of this workshop is to learn the fundamentals of [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/). 
* In the morning session, I will demo how to setup/install tailwindcss, and go over some essential utility classes, and teach you the fundamental concepts of tailwindcss.
  
Students learn and finish the workshop assignment as follows:
1. Refactor Homework 01 portfolio to use tailwindcss.
2. Refactor Homework 02 layout exercises to use tailwindcss, including the responsive layout.
3. Submit/push your refactored code.
  
I'm available to answer any questions between 10:00 AM to noon, and 2:00 PM to 5:00 PM. When you finish, explore [tailwind components](https://tailwindui.com/?ref=top) and [templates](https://www.tailwindawesome.com/?price=free&type=template).

Happy Styling!
