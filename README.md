### CS472-Workshop-Tailwindcss
The goal of this workshop is to master working with [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/). 
1. We start the workshop with a demo on how to setup/install tailwindcss, and go over some essential utility classes, and learn the layout classes for `grid`, `flex`, and `position`.
2. Learn the essential utility classes by following this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxmDnn7lrnk&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9gpXORlEHjc5bgnIi5HEGhw), you will learn better if you watch a section, and then implement the changes without guide.
3. Learn about [Tailwind's @apply](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/reusing-styles#extracting-classes-with-apply) directive to extract repeated utility patterns into custom CSS classes.
4. Refactor Homework 01 portfolio to use tailwind.
5. Refactor Homework 02 layout exercises to use tailwind, including the responsive layout.
6. Submit/push your refactored code by the end of the day.
  
I'm available to answer any questions between 10:00 AM to noon, and 2:00 PM to 5:00 PM. When you finish, explore [tailwind components](https://tailwindui.com/?ref=top) and [templates](https://www.tailwindawesome.com/?price=free&type=template).

Happy Styling!
